- ðŸ‘‹ I'm Damon

I'm 21 years old currently learning software engineering through Hyperion Dev, I love programming, working with new technologies and always looking to expand my knowledge, I matriculated from Vryburger Highschool in 2020 and have worked a few jobs but nothing tech related so far so I don't count it as experience. Really eager to find my first internship or possibly junior role to get my foot in the door of the tech industry.
